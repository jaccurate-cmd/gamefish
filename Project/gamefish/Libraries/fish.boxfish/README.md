---

#### About

The library should work straight out the box without any crazy setup.
You should aim to use the `VoxelVolume` or `NetworkedVoxelVolume` components, if those don't fulfil your needs, look at implementing your own `BaseVoxelVolume<T, U>`.

#### Example

You can view examples of how to use the library on this [GitHub page](https://github.com/Small-Fish-Dev/boxfish-example/tree/main), or see the library action on [sbox.game](https://sbox.game/fish/boxfish-example).

#### Issues

If you encounter issues with the library, please open an issue, or a pull request to fix said issue.

In your issue (or pull request) describe the problem, and the steps for reproducing said problem.
