# Progress

It ain't done yet, but it's got some gems already. Take a peek.

If you like what you see then remember: it's all MIT licensed. And we do like hearing that you used it.

# Game Fish

### What?

It'll be a series of "kits" with a base library that already has a ton of great utilities.

A "kit" lets you drop something in your project and get started with a type of game right away.

**Examples:**
- FPS Kit
- Vehicle Kit
- Platformer Kit

And they would all be able interact with each other where it makes sense.

### Why?

Games share lots of code, reuse lots of systems.

It'd be alot easier if you didn't waste time reinventing the wheel.

This effort is about allowing you to not do that and just make your game.
